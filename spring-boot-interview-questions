1. What is Spring Boot?
A framework that simplifies Spring development using auto-configuration, embedded servers, and starter dependencies.

2. Why use Spring Boot?
Fast development, minimal configuration, embedded Tomcat/Jetty, auto-config, and starter dependencies.

3. What is auto-configuration?
Spring Boot automatically configures beans based on classpath and properties.

4. What are Spring Boot Starters?
Predefined dependencies that reduce manual version management.
Example: spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.

5. Difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
Spring → Requires manual config.
Spring Boot → Auto-config + embedded server + starters.

6. What is Spring Boot Actuator?
Provides production-ready endpoints like /health, /metrics, /info.

7. How to enable Actuator?
Add dependency: spring-boot-starter-actuator.

8. What is Spring Boot CLI?
Command-line tool to run Groovy scripts quickly.

9. What is Spring Initializr?
Online generator to create Spring Boot project structures.

10. What is @SpringBootApplication?
Meta-annotation combining @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan.

11. What is @RestController?
Combines @Controller + @ResponseBody to return JSON directly.

12. How do you create a REST API?
Use @RestController + @GetMapping / @PostMapping.

13. What is @RequestMapping?
Maps HTTP requests to methods.

14. Difference between @GetMapping and @PostMapping?
@GetMapping → Read data
@PostMapping → Create data

15. Purpose of application.properties?
Externalized configuration: DB, port, logging, etc.

16. How to change server port?
server.port=8081

17. Difference between JPA and Hibernate?
JPA → Specification
Hibernate → Implementation of JPA

18. What is an embedded server?
Built-in Tomcat/Jetty that runs inside the application. No external server needed.

19. How do you handle exceptions?
Use @RestControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.

20. What is Spring Boot DevTools?
Provides auto-restart and live reload during development.

21. What is Spring Security?
Framework for authentication and authorization.

22. What are Spring Profiles?
Environment-specific configs (dev, test, prod).
Activate using: spring.profiles.active=dev

23. What is caching in Spring Boot?
Use @EnableCaching, @Cacheable, @CacheEvict to store method results.

24. How to schedule tasks?
Use @EnableScheduling + @Scheduled.

25. What is CommandLineRunner?
Runs code immediately after startup.

26. Difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository?
All are beans but used for semantic roles:
@Component → generic
@Service → business logic
@Repository → DB layer + exception translation

27. How to run Spring Boot as a JAR?
Build: mvn clean install
Run: java -jar app.jar

28. What is @ConfigurationProperties?
Binds external config into POJO.

29. What is SpringApplication.run()?
Starts the application, loads context, initializes beans, and starts embedded server.
